# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python 
# programming language:

# LIST is a collection which is ordered and changeable. 
        # Allows duplicate members.
# TUPLE is a collection which is ordered and UNchangeable.
        #  Allows duplicate members.
# SET is a collection which is unordered, UNchangeable*, 
        # and unindexed. NO duplicate members.
# DICTIONARY is a collection which is ordered** and 
        # changeable. NO duplicate members.




# *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove 
# and/or add items whenever you like.

# **As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
# In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
